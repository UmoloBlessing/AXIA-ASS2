    <div class="header2">WHAT IS NIGERIAN FOOD?</div>
    <p>Nigerian food represents the cuisines of the more than 250 ethnic groups that comprise Nigeria. It shares many similarities with the cuisines of its West African and Central African neighbors like Ghana, Benin, and Cameroon. Starchy foods like yam, cassava, plantains, rice, and beans figure prominently in the Nigerian diet. They're often consumed with a wide array of hearty soups and stews made with different types of meat and vegetables. Nigerians are fond of vegetable stews and typically consume it several times a week.</p>

        <h2>Amala and Ewedu Soup</h2>
        <p>Ewedu soup is a Nigerian soup made with jute leaves, a type of leafy vegetable common in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. It's native to the Yoruba people of western Nigeria but it's common in other parts of West Africa, East Africa, and North Africa as well.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p id="paragragh">Ingredients</p>
        <ol>
            <li>jute leaves</li>
            <li>African crayfish</li>
            <li>bouillon powder</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>locust beans</li>

        </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p id="paragragh">Procedures</p>
        <p>To prepare, jute leaves are mashed, often with a short broomstick called ijabe, and then cooked with ground African crayfish, bouillon powder, salt, and locust beans. When cooked, the leaves develop a somewhat slimy viscosity similar to okra. </p>
        <p>Ewedu soup is commonly paired with amala but it can be eaten with other types of Nigerian swallow food like fufu, eba, or pounded yam. Amala is typically made with dried yam (amala isu) which gives it a brown color, but it can be made with cassava (amala lafun) or plantain (amala ogede) as well.</p>
        <p>Ewedu soup can be served on its own with amala, but it isn’t uncommon to find it served with other types of Nigerian stew as well like buka stew and/or gbegiri soup. As you can probably guess, the bowl of green soup below is ewedu soup.</p>
